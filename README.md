# Python CHIP-8 Emulator

This is a Python implementation of a CHIP-8 emulator. The CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language used in the late 1970s and early 1980s to develop simple video games. This emulator allows you to run and play those classic games on your computer. Although kinda slow !

## Installation

To run the emulator, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/curiousmn/chip8-python.git
cd python-chip8
```

## Usage

To run the emulator, simply execute the following command:

```
pip3 install pygame
python chip8.py
```

This will start the emulator and display the CHIP-8 screen. You can use the keyboard to interact with the emulator and play the games.
